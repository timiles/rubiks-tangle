# rubiks-tangle
JavaScript solution for 5x5 grid of Rubik's Tangle tiles.

# TODO
- [x] display solution in UI
- [x] run algorithm in background thread, updating UI
- [x] add counter to track number of tile placements
- [x] do multiple test runs with randomised tiles to benchmark average algorithm performance 
- [x] improve algorithm performance: implement "expanding squares" method
- [ ] improve algorithm performance: detect impossible tile placements sooner?
- [ ] increase browser support: only tested in Chrome so far
- [ ] increase browser support: graceful degradation when HTML5 Web Workers not available
