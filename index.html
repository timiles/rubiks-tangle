        <blockquote>
            <p>
                &ldquo;To unravel the 4 coloured ropes 25 identical tiles have to be arranged in a square so that the ropes form continuous lines.
                The task is straightforward.  Trying is fun.  The more tiles in place the harder it gets &mdash; the complete solution is a daunting challenge.&rdquo;

            So says the intro to a puzzle that's been on my parents' shelf probably my whole life.  Every few years, usually at Christmas,
            someone might have a go at solving it &ndash; but always to no avail.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Curious to know how &ldquo;daunting&rdquo; this challenge really is, I took it upon myself to hammer out some JavaScript in the Chrome console
            on an old laptop.  A couple hours later (progress slowing after lunchtime booze), we had, for the first time since the 80s,
            a solution to the Tangle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code behind this page not only finds a solution, but also counts the number of tile comparisons required to reach this solution:
            my algorithm averages out at over 40 million checks, but can easily take 3&times; that many, depending on the order in which we pick up the tiles.
            If we had persevered at checking one tile per second, and did not rest till a solution was found, it would likely have taken us over a year at least.
            Daunting, indeed!
